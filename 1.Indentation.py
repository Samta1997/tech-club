# 1. What will happen if the following code is not properly indented?
# def greet():
#     print("Hello, world!")

#2. Correct the indentation in this Python code:
# for i in range(3):
# print(i)
#     if i == 1:
#         print("Number is one")


#3. Why does the following code raise an IndentationError?
# x = 5
#     if x > 3:
#         print("x is greater than 3")

#4 What will happen if different levels of indentation are mixed in a Python code block?
'''Answer: If you mix tabs and spaces or use inconsistent indentation, Python will raise 
an IndentationError. Indentation needs to be consistent (either all spaces or all tabs) 
throughout the code block.'''
